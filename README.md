# Blog-
Welcome to My Blog Website! This is a simple project made in Python and Django for backend,  CSS,HTML,JS for frontend and postgresql for stored the data. The idea behind the project is to learn how to implement a simple blog, apply CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations and learn how to deal with Postgresql with Django.
The schema name is blogproject and I used pgadmin 4 to store the data in myschema and apply the CRUD operations on it.
